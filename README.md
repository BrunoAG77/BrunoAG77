ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Bruno Antico Galin, a data scientist/analyst. My main motivation is to learn more and more about this area and interact with colleagues to create a positive environment. I speak English fluently and speak Spanish at an intermediate level. I can program in languages â€‹â€‹that work with data, such as Python (libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly), R and SQL, and I can use Excel and PowerBI for data analysis. I consider myself an organized and committed person who will always strive for the best.
